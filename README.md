Group Members + Statements:
Michael Bashner
I created the initial database and managed the relational models. I created the ability for users to sign and unsign a petition and that their signature is counted. I helped with file management. I worked to adjust our templates to utilize bootstrap 4 and now bootstrap 5. I adjusted forms to allow for a cancel button to be used. I implemented the querying of the petitions on the homepage. Also, I did some work on page weight, such as only loading moment js on pages that use it. Lastly, I used my background from csc 170 and 174 to try and make sure the html uses best industry practices when possible. Also, I helped with bug fixing.
Nate Webber
I handled almost exclusively backend parts of the project. I did all of the user authentication and registration, as well as a lot of the petition management features, such as submitting new petitions and deleting existing ones. I also, like everyone else, helped out occasionally in all aspects with bug squashing. 
Zeke Brecher
I was primarily focused on the frontend and making sure all the navigation was intuitive for the user. In the beginning I created the navigation and made sure each individual route was easy to traverse and accessible. I did touch-ups on the styling of each page and drew a neat background using the UR specific color palette. I also contributed to the occasional minor bug fix here and there.
